## **Project Goals**

As my fifth project for the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) 5P course, the goal of the project is to demonstrate all of the skills I have learned in the course so far including languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python. Frameworks such as Django and Bootstrap and version control technologies such as Git and Github.
